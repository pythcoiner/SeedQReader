SeedQReader
---

SeedQReader is a simple tool i made for communicate with my SeedSigner.

It actually can send/receive:
- 1 Frame QRCodes
- Multiframes QRCodes using the `Specter` format (1of3 dddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd)

The 'split' size can be set with `MAX_LEN`

Delay between 2 frames can be set with `QR_DELAY`
